Project Structure
main.py: Handles video processing and object detection (vehicles, license plate, and plate’s numbers).
initial.py: Script for marking parking spots manually and initializing a parking lot in the database.
Django Backend: Manages API endpoints, WebSocket, and database interactions.
React Native App: Displays parking lots status in real time and manages user interactions.
settings.py: Configures database, authentication, and WebSocket settings.
Installation
Prerequisites
Raspberry Pi 5 with Camera Module 3.
Python 3.x installed on the Raspberry Pi.
Django installed (pip install django).
React Native setup for the frontend.
Setup Instructions
Clone this repository:
git clone <repository-url>
Install Python dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Open a terminal on your Raspberry Pi and set up a Django server:
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
Run the Django server:
daphne -b 0.0.0.0 -p 8000 parkingProject.asgi:application
For initializing a new parking lot, go to the parkingProject folder:
python3 -m parkingApp.initial
